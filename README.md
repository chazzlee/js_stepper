It allows the user to score notes by clicking on different sections of the grid that maps to a musicial note.

## Functionality

- Place various notes by clicking on the grid
- Extend or shorten note duration by increasing the width/length of the note/bar
- Play back the music
- Change tempo
- Change note velocity/volume
- Change different sounds/instruments
